        <h2>About the whale shark</h2>
        <p>
          The whale shark is a slow-moving, filter-feeding carpet shark and the
          largest known extant fish species. The largest confirmed individual
          had a length of 18.8 m. The whale shark holds many records for size in
          the animal kingdom, most notably being by far the largest living
          nonmammalian vertebrate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Preferring warm waters, whale sharks populate all tropical seas. They
          are known to migrate every spring to the continental shelf of the
          central west coast of Australia. The coral spawning of the area's
          Ningaloo Reef provides the whale shark with an abundant supply of
          plankton.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although massive, whale sharks are docile fish and sometimes allow
          swimmers to hitch a ride. They are currently listed as a vulnerable
          species; however, they continue to be hunted in parts of Asia, such as
          the Philippines.
        </p>
        <h2>Why do whale sharks matter?</h2>
        <p>
          The whale shark is the biggest fish and shark in the world. These
          gentle marine giants roam the oceans around the globe, generally
          alone. However, large numbers of whale sharks often gather in areas
          with abundant plankton foodâ€”making them prime tourist attractions.The
          distribution of whale sharks indicates the presence of plankton and
          the overall health of our oceans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whale sharks are highly valued on international markets. Demand for
          their meat, fins and oil remains a threat to the species, particularly
          by unregulated fisheries. They are victims of bycatch, the accidental
          capture of non-target species in fishing gear. And whale shark tourism
          presents a threat to the species as it can interrupt their feeding and
          sharks can be injured by boat propellers.
