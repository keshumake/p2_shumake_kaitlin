      <h2>About the whale shark</h2>
      <p>
        The whale shark is a slow-moving, filter-feeding carpet shark and the
        largest known extant fish species. The largest confirmed individual
        had a length of 18.8 m. The whale shark holds many records for size in
        the animal kingdom, most notably being by far the largest living
        nonmammalian vertebrate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preferring warm waters, whale sharks populate all tropical seas. They
        are known to migrate every spring to the continental shelf of the
        central west coast of Australia. The coral spawning of the area's
        Ningaloo Reef provides the whale shark with an abundant supply of
        plankton.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although massive, whale sharks are docile fish and sometimes allow
        swimmers to hitch a ride. They are currently listed as a vulnerable
        species; however, they continue to be hunted in parts of Asia, such as
        the Philippines.
      </p>
      <h2>Why do whale sharks matter?</h2>
      <p>
        The whale shark is the biggest fish and shark in the world. These
        gentle marine giants roam the oceans around the globe, generally
        alone. However, large numbers of whale sharks often gather in areas
        with abundant plankton food—making them prime tourist attractions.The
        distribution of whale sharks indicates the presence of plankton and
        the overall health of our oceans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whale sharks are highly valued on international markets. Demand for
        their meat, fins and oil remains a threat to the species, particularly
        by unregulated fisheries. They are victims of bycatch, the accidental
        capture of non-target species in fishing gear. And whale shark tourism
        presents a threat to the species as it can interrupt their feeding and
        sharks can be injured by boat propellers.

      <h2>Whale Shark Facts</h2>
      <img src="images/whale.png" alt="Whale Shark Icon">
      <p>&bullet; The whale shark is the largest fish in the world and the largest fish known to have lived on this planet.
        Because of its size and cartilaginous skeleton, it does not fossilize well and in life it is very difficult to
        weigh accurately.</p>
      <p>&bullet; Whale shark has a two-toned pattern of light spots on its dark gray back with a white underside.</p>
      <p>&bullet; Teeth of the whale shark are tiny and pointed backward; they are thought to have no function in feeding.</p>
      <p>&bullet; A whale shark filters food from the water by “cross-flow filtration,” which means the particles do not catch on the filter. Rather, water is directed away through the gills while particles (which have more momentum) carry on towards the back of the mouth in an ever more concentrated stream. A bolus or spinning ball of food grows in diameter at the back of the throat until it triggers a swallowing reflex. This is very efficient and does not clog the filters.</p>
      <p>&bullet; Typically found offshore but will come close to shore, sometimes entering lagoons or coral atolls. Frequents shallow water areas near bays and upwelling coastal areas near continental drop-offs, sometimes during seasonal plankton blooms.</p>
