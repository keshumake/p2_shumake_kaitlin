        <h2>About the Whale Shark</h2>
        <img src="./images/sea.png" alt="Sea icon" />
        <p>
          The whale shark is a slow-moving, filter-feeding carpet shark and
          the largest known extant fish species. The largest confirmed
          individual had a length of 18.8 m. The whale shark holds many
          records for size in the animal kingdom, most notably being by far
          the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) are the largest shark, and indeed
          largest of any fishes alive today. They feed on plankton and travel
          large distances to find enough food to sustain their huge size, and
          to reproduce. Whale sharks are found in all the tropical oceans of
          the world. Their white spotted colouration makes these gentle giants
          easy to distinguish, and popular with snorkelers and divers at sites
          where they aggregate off the coast.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whale shark's flattened head sports a blunt snout above its
          mouth with short barbels protruding from its nostrils. Its back and
          sides are gray to brown with white spots among pale vertical and
          horizontal stripes, and its belly is white. Its two dorsal fins are
          set rearward on its body, which ends in a large dual-lobbed caudal
          fin (or tail).

        <p>
          Like human fingerprints, whale sharks have a unique pattern of spots
          which allow individual sharks to be identified. By taking photos and
          cataloguing them,
          <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/whale-shark">WWF</a>
          has identified 458 different whale sharks in the Philippines.

          Females give birth to live young but this has never been observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where pupping occurs and where the youngest animals situate remains
          a mystery, as they are very rarely found.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adults are often found feeding at the surface, but may dive to
          1000m.
